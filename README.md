# ICMS-Classification
Intracortical Microstimulation (ICMS) in the primary visual cortex (V1) has been proposed as a tool to restore vision in blind humans with accumulating efforts for about half a century. Electrical stimulation in V1 seems to produce a visual sensation of a small point of light, termed as phosphene. ICMS in monkeysâ€™ V1 produces behavioral effects that are consistent with phosphene induction.
The goal for this project is to determine whether there was an electrical stimulus on the brain using voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks.
